This program is a PILOT project.
It is a trial of the Python programming language possibilities in the framework of a move towards open source.
It could be used instead of the presently used RATS program to compute indicators needed for assessing both the productive capacity
(i.e. potential output) and cyclical position (i.e. output gaps) of EU economies.
